    <h1>My Dearest Mema,</h1>

    <p>
      I’ve been trying to find the right words for a long time, and I’m not sure they’ll ever be enough, but I need you to know how deeply I appreciate you and everything you’ve been to me.
    </p>

    <p>
      You hold a place in my heart that no one else ever could. Being with you felt natural, warm, and real in a way I’ve never known before. Those days we shared together were truly beautiful, full of laughter, comfort, and a quiet happiness that I still carry with me.
    </p>

    <p>
      I genuinely wanted my life to continue with you right beside me. I imagined the future with you not as a dream, but as something I believed in with my whole heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      No matter where life takes us now, please know that what we had mattered.
      You mattered. And you always will.
    </p>

      <p>
        I know I may not be able to give you the little "Kinder Surprise Egg" I once did anymore,
        and that thought isn’t easy for me. So I wanted the one in the background to be one last gentle surprise,
        something simple, sincere, and made with love. Not to replace what was, but to honor it,
        and to remind you that you were, and always will be, someone truly special to me.
      </p>

      With all the love and appreciation my heart can hold, Hashem.
