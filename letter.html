    <h1>My Dearest Mema,</h1>

    <p>
      I’ve been trying to find the right words for a long time, and I’m not sure they’ll ever be enough—but I need you to know how deeply I appreciate you and everything you’ve been to me.
    </p>

    <p>
      You hold a place in my heart that no one else ever could. Being with you felt natural, warm, and real in a way I’ve never known before. Those days we shared together were truly beautiful—full of laughter, comfort, and a quiet happiness that I still carry with me.
    </p>

    <p>
      I genuinely wanted my life to continue with you right beside me. I imagined the future with you—not as a dream, but as something I believed in with my whole heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      No matter where life takes us now, please know that what we had mattered. You mattered. And you always will.
    </p>

    <p class="signature">
      With all the love and appreciation my heart can hold,<br>
      Hashem.
